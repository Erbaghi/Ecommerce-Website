# How to run project
- To get this project up and running you should start by having Python installed on your computer. It's advised you create a virtual environment to store your projects dependencies separately. You can install virtualenv with

```
pip install virtualenv
```
- Clone this project.
- In the base directory of the project run this command:
```
python -m venv .venv
```
- This will create a folder called `.venv` in your project directory.
- To activate it run these commands according to your OS:
```
  # for mac and linux:
  source .venv/bin/activate
  # for windows:
  cd .venv/scripts
  activate
```
- Then you have to install all the dependencies that you need for this project to run as expected on your computer:
```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Now you're ready to run the project using this command:
```
pyton manage.py runserver
```
